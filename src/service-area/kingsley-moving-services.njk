    <p class="my-5">The land Kingsley sits on today was originally owned by its founders, Judson Kingsley and Myron S. Brownson. In 1872, the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed between Cadillac and Traverse City. Kingsley built a station for the new railroad, which happened to run through his property. Kingsley also opened a post office, known as Kingsley Station. In 1876, Judson Kingsley platted Kingsley Station as a new village under the shortened name of Kingsley.</p>
    <p class="my-5">In 1874, Brownson, a practicing medic from Steuben County, New York, bought land adjacent to that of Kingsley. In July 1882, Brownson platted his land into a new settlement he called Paradise. In 1893, the villages of Kingsley and Paradise united and incorporated under the name of Kingsley </p>
